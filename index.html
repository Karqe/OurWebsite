        <p>
          Rocket League is a fantastical sport-based video game, developed by
          Psyonix (it’s “soccer with cars”). It features a competitive game mode
          based on teamwork and outmaneuvering opponents. Players work with
          their team to advance the ball down the field, and score goals in
          their opponents’ net. Rocket League is a technical game which involves
          both high-level dexterity and fast-paced gameplay. While one of the
          most welcoming elements of the game is its accessibility and
          familiarity with traditional sport (soccer), the best players are
          highly advanced and have fine-tuned their mechanics.
